# Deepfake-Generation-and-Detection
This project creates and detects deepfakes. We use InsightFace for face analysis and imswaper_128.onnx for face-swapping. For detection, CNN and Meso4 models identify deepfakes, supporting secure and reliable digital media analysis. The project has both academic and practical applications.
